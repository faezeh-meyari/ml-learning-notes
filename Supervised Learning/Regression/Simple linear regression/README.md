# Simple Linear Regression on Height and Weight Dataset

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a simple linear regression model to predict a person's weight based on their height using a publicly available dataset. The goal is to understand basic regression concepts and evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains paired samples of height (in inches or centimeters) and corresponding weight (in pounds or kilograms) for individuals. The data is from Kaggle's "Heights and Weights" dataset.

## Current Status
- Implemented a simple linear regression model.
- Calculated evaluation metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
- Initial results show that height alone explains approximately 25-26% of the variance in weight, indicating other factors affect weight prediction.

## Future Work
- Explore additional features that might improve prediction accuracy.
- Implement more advanced regression models.
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Add detailed visualizations and explanations.

## Usage
1. Install required packages (e.g., scikit-learn, numpy, pandas).
2. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or scripts to reproduce the results.

## Notes
This is an ongoing project and will be updated with improvements and new features.
